# YOUR AUTONOMOUS AND AFFORDABLE RASPBERRY PI ROBOT IS HERE – Easy to build, easy to use...

## Meet Endiran – your DIY simple open-source robotic solution

In the near future we will see autonomous cars on the roads. Actually we already have cars with autonomous capabilities such as parallel parking functions and systems that keep the car within the marked driving lanes etc. Many car manufactures, are investing in autonomous cars as it is going to be the future.

So how does a car drive by itself? As an electrical engineer specializing in automation and robot technology this topic has always been of great interest to me, and it has helped me lay the foundation for the whole mental process required for advanced system development. The answer to the question is to be found in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

During my childhood, I was always interested in building robots. After taking an online Stanford University machine learning course, I decided to build my own autonomous robot.

At the outset of such a project, there are a number of important considerations to bear in mind. First and foremost there are the economic considerations, where the cost of the final product must be competitive. Furthermore, my goal was to keep the building and programming of the robot as user - friendly and simple as possible. This would entail minimizing the number of lines of code, so you would not be required to have an engineering background or have taken a course in machine learning and artificial Intelligence to be able to use the robot.

So how can I make a simple and cheap autonomous robot without needing to spend unnecessary money on software?
